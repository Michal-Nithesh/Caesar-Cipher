# Caesar Cipher

## Introduction
The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## How It Works
- **Encryption**: To encrypt a message using the Caesar Cipher, each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' would be replaced by 'D', 'B' would become 'E', and so on.
- **Decryption**: Decryption is performed by shifting the letters in the ciphertext in the opposite direction of the encryption. For example, if the original message was shifted by 3 positions, decryption would involve shifting each letter back by 3 positions.

## Example
- **Plaintext**: HELLO
- **Shift**: 3
- **Ciphertext**: KHOOR
- **Decryption (with a shift of 3)**: KHOOR â†’ HELLO
